## README

This is the repository that contains my *ui* and *server* codes of the web application that I created in *Shiny* as my final assignment in the course of Developing Data Products by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. 

This Shiny APP shows Google data of social mobility trends over time across different categories of places in Peru (my country). Also, this APP has the option to exclude weekends to have a better visualization of the trend in each indicator. The APP can be accessed [here](https://karlmc83.shinyapps.io/assignmentweek4/).

I also share the code of my presentation in RStudio Presenter that was published in RPubs. It can be accessed [here](https://rpubs.com/Karl83/849099). 

The file "AssignmentWeek4" contains the following codes:

1. The file "ui.R" contains the user-interface definition of the Shiny web application.

2. The file "server.R" is the server logic of the Shiny web application.

3. The file "Code.R" contains a code to download the data directly from Google.

4. The file "Presentation.Rpres" contains my presentation in RStudio Presenter. It can be read in the file "Presentation.md" which is in Markdown format.
